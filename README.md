# Algorithms

This repository contains solutions to algorithm problems from Code Wars, LeetCode, and Interview. 
Each algorithm problem has its own folder in the `/src` directory, with the following structure:


The `/algo.ts` file contains the main logic for solving the algorithm problem, 
while the `/algo.test.ts` file contains tests to ensure the solution is correct. 
If needed, a `/algo.mocks.ts` file can be used to provide mock data for testing, 
and a `/algo.types.ts` file can be used to store shared types that are used in multiple files.

Feel free to use these solutions as a reference or for inspiration when solving algorithm problems on your own.
